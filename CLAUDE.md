# Project Guidelines

## Temporary Files

Always use the project-local `tmp/` directory for temporary files instead of the system `/tmp`.

## Legacy Plugins

The `koishi-old-plugin` directory contains plugins previously used with Koishi framework. These plugins are archived and no longer under active development.
